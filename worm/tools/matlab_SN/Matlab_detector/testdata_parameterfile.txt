%main tunable parameters of algorithm
%this block of parameters can either be unstaged in which case each is set to a single number
%or they can be staged in which case staging defines which parameter setting is used for a given number of cells
% e.g. the 0-102 cells will use the first value in the array and so on. The setting arrays should have one more element than the stage array.


%stages (in number of cells) at which to switch between parameters that are arranged in blocks
parameters.staging=[102,181,251,351];


% threshold on noise maximas to discard the higher the number the more maxima will be discarded
%this is often the only parameter that needs to be changed to achieve good results in new images

%size filter used in terms of increments of expected diameter (usually 1, sometimes it is useful to set it lower in already blurry images)
parameters.sigma=1;



% threshold on slice inclusion in a nucleus, the bigger the number is the more likely it is to include ambigious slices in any potential nucleus
parameters.rangethreshold=[100,100,15,8,4,3];

% distance at which to merge overlapping nuclei (the larger it is the fewer nuclei will be detected)
parameters.nndist_merge=[.8,.6,.6,.5,.4,.4];
 
% mergescore above which consider merging if split is really bad (the lower (the more negative) it is the more merging will occur)

%split score  below which consider merging nuclei even though merge score isnt so good (the higher it is the more merging will occur)
