For instructions on building and installing the software from source code,
see the file in this directory named 'INSTALL'.

starrynite has one required dependency:

* libtiff
  http://www.libtiff.org/

and several optional dependencies:

* python
  http://www.python.org/
  
  The python development libraries are required to build the Python
  language bindings for starrynite.  This option is enabled by passing
  --enable-python to configure.

* xsdcxx
  http://codesynthesis.com/projects/xsd/

  The CodeSynthesis XSD development libraries are required to build
  support for XML serialization and deserialization.  This option also
  requires a C++ compiler, and is enabled by passing --enable-xml to
  configure.

* autoconf 2.6.1 or greater
  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  autoconf can be used to rebuild the script 'configure' from
  configure.ac.

* automake 1.10 or greater
  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  automake can be used to regenerate the Makefile.in files used during the
  build.

* gperf
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/

  gperf can be used to regenerate the file parameters-tools.c from its
  source, parameters-tools.gperf.

* doxygen
  http://www.doxygen.org/

  doxygen can be used to generate documentation for libstarrynite with
  'make doxygen-doc'.

* cython
  http://www.cython.org/

  cython can be used to regenerate the Python-specific interface files
  from their sources in lib/starrynite-py.
  
For a list of other configuration options, use:

./configure --help
