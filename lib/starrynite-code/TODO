* Continue eliminating over-general parameter types from function
  parameter lists:

    TOOL_t, PARAMETER_t and MOVIE_t are too big and non-specific;
    subfunctions using them should be simplified.

    Going through the subfunctions and eliminating TOOL_t, PARAMETER,t
    and MOVIE_t where possible will make the code easier to understand
    and more flexible.

* Improve the library functions

    Make sure they are simple, organized, well-named and documented.

* Add Doxygen doc comments

* Improve the language bindings

* Address TODO notes in code.

* THINGS THAT COULD BE FLOATING-POINT:

- **xrange: see initialize_slice, set to (int) sqrtf(dist)
