Building starrynite from the source code under version control requires
some additional tools, such as gperf.

* If you have all the required tools, you can build from freshly
checked-out code using:

$ ./configure
$ make

make should inform you if any required programs are missing.

* If you don't have these tools installed, it should suffice simply to
unpack a recent distribution into the source tree.  

For example, with GNU tar and a recent source distribution (named
something like starrynite-1.4.6.tar.gz), change into the project's
root directory (the one with 'configure') and use:

$ tar --strip-components 1 -xzf starrynite-1.4.6.tar.gz
