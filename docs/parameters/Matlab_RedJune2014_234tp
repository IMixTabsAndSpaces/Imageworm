%Diameter of a nucleus at start time. 
%At the first time point this parameter needs to be manually set to the size of the nuclei. 
%For elongated nuclei it should be set a little higher than the short axis.

%Used to index into parameters when they are divided up by cell stage.

%Main Tunable Parameters:

%Stages (in number of cells) at which to switch between parameter blocks.

%20110203 parameters.staging=[102,181,251,351,500];
parameters.staging=[60,181,251,351,500];

%Threshold on noise maxima to discard (this can be staged as well)
%(threshold for a significantly bright slice).
%This should be set a little lower than the brightest filtered 3D maxima corresponding to a nucleus. 
%example:parameters.intensitythreshold=[8,10,14,16,21,21]

%Size filter used in terms of increments of expected diameter.
%1 is usually a good value. 
%If nuclei are very separated and strongly multi modal GFP is causing FP this can be raised to smooth more.
%in that case minDrop typically needs to be raised also to compensate for this blurring.
%example:parameters.sigma=1
parameters.sigma=1;

%This block of parameters can either be unstaged in which case are set to number
%or staged in which case staging defines the cell stages eg 0-102 cells range is 100.

%Threshold on slice inclusion in a nucleus. 
%the bigger the number is the less likely it is to split ambigious cases into two halves.

%This is the primary parameter influencing 3D nuclear extraction and iterative discovery of overlooked nuclei. 
%When nuclei are well separated it will have relatively little effect, 
%but should be set relatively high to avoid splitting nuclei into multiple fragments during extraction
%and to ensure nuclei initially detected twice are merged (which will not happen if their slice sets do not overlap). 
%When images are relatively crowded a low single digit number is typically best, representing a slight bias to claim unlikely looking slices, 
%but not so high as to cause the claiming of entire separate nuclei.
%example: parameters.rangethreshold=[100,15,8,6,3];
%parameters.rangethreshold=[84,21,9,6,4,3];
%parameters.rangethreshold=[84,31,21,15,10,10];
%20110107 parameters.rangethreshold=[84,31,21,15,2,1];
%Red67parameters.rangethreshold=[84,31,21,20,10,8];
parameters.rangethreshold=[84,31,21,20,10,8];

%Distance at which to merge overlapping nuclei (the larger it is the fewer nuclei will be detected).
%Distance between their centers at which nuclei with overlapping slice sets are merged regardless of other scores. 
%In crowded and undersampled images detected centers are often much closer to each other in z than would appear possible given physical constraints. 
%This requires relatively low thresholds .5 (meaning the center of one nucleus should not sit within the radial boundary of the other) is a typically safe value. 
%In uncrowded images this can be increased because nuclei are more distant and overlaps are much more likely to correspond to multiple detections of one nucleus. 
%example: parameters.nndist_merge=[.6,.6,.5,.5,.4];
%Red67parameters.nndist_merge=[.8,.65,.6,.63,.5,.4];
parameters.nndist_merge=[.8,.65,.6,.63,.55,.4];
 
%Mergescore above which consider merging if split is really bad (lower it is more merging will occur).
%Really bad merge score threshold above which things can be merged if their split score is also terrible. 
%With MinsplitThreshold above these 2 parameters define an unbounded upper left rectangular gating region corresponding to malformed nuclei 
%that are always merged with their overlapping neighbor.
parameters.mergelower=[-200,-100,-75,-95,-90,-80];

%Split score below which consider merging nuclei even though merge score isnt so good.
%Threshold on split score below which things will be merged even if their merge score is not great as long as it is better than MinMergeThreshold below. 
%A small single digit number is a universally safe starting point. Again this parameter is less critical.
parameters.split=[15,9,6,5,3,3];

%Merge overlappping nuclei if their aspect ratio is smaller than this.
%Aspect ration between height (in z) and diameter. If 2 nuclei when merged have an aspect ratio below this cutoff they are merged regardless of merge/split scores. 
%Given the presence of optical distortion that makes nuclei look stretched in z a relatively high number for this eg 1.5 is preferable in uncrowded images, 
%while in crowded images nuclei may appear much shorter than their diameter requiring a threshold below 1.  
%parameters.armerge=[1.6,1.6,1.3,1.12, 0.8,.62];

parameters.armerge=[1.6,1.6,1.3,1.2,1.1,1.0];

%Fraction by which split needs to be larger than merge to keep overlapping nuclei separate.
%How much better the split score needs to be than the merge score before overlapping nuclei are split. 
%1 is a good default value, it can be decreased to bias toward merging if too many FP are present, 
%but the gain is somewhat minimal for low throughput applications, being fractions of a percent of error. 
parameters.mergesplit=[1,.5,.4,.4,.5,.6];


%Tunable parameters that users arent likely to change:

%Threshold on a boundary ray that is too much longer than its neighbor.
%The maximum allowable difference between two adjacent ray lengths. 1.5 is a good default.
%More elongated nuclei need a higher value, but this carries some risk of merging crowded adjacent nuclei.
parameters.large_ray_threshold=1.55;

%Threshold on a boundary ray that is too much shorter than its neighbor.
%The minimum allowable difference between adjacent slices.
%It is not typically necessary to adjust this. 
parameters.small_ray_threshold=1/3;

%Boundary of nucleus is based on isocontour representing 70 % of maximum intensity.
%The drop in value from the maximum which is deemed ‘close enough’ to a zero crossing.
%.3 is a reasonable default (a 70% drop).
%If the image appears blurry it should be set a bit higher to prevent overestimation of diameter and hence over smoothing.
